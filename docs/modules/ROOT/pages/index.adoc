This project is a multi-module Spring Boot playground showcasing REST APIs, configuration, security, OpenAPI, JPA + Flyway, Thymeleaf MVC, Admin monitoring, and AI integrations.

== Module Map

- spring-boot-rest-sample — REST API basics
- spring-boot-config-sample — Externalized configuration patterns
- spring-boot-admin-server — Admin UI for monitoring apps
- spring-boot-config-server — Centralized configuration service
- spring-boot-data-jpa-flyway — Persistence + migrations
- spring-boot-openapi-root — Parent for OpenAPI samples
- spring-boot-thymeleaf — Server-side MVC with Thymeleaf
- spring-boot-security-root — Parent for security samples
- spring-boot-security-basic — Basic auth demo
- spring-boot-security-jwt — JWT-based security demo
- spring-boot-ai-samples — Spring AI integrations
- openapi-sample (under spring-boot-openapi-root) — Concrete OpenAPI demo

== spring-boot-rest-sample

A reference REST service demonstrating:
- CRUD endpoints with JSON payloads
- Bean validation and error handling
- Controller advice for exceptions
- Meaningful HTTP status codes

How to run:
- mvn spring-boot:run
- Explore endpoints under /api

Learning goals:
- Build clean REST controllers
- Structure DTOs/validation
- Centralize error responses

== spring-boot-config-sample

Externalized configuration patterns:
- application.yaml + profiles
- @ConfigurationProperties with validation
- Metadata via configuration processor

How to run:
- Use -Dspring.profiles.active=dev|prod to switch environments

Learning goals:
- Safe, typed configuration binding
- Profile-specific settings
- Documenting configuration

== spring-boot-admin-server

Admin console to monitor Spring Boot apps:
- Health, metrics, environment, logs
- JVM info and endpoints overview

How to run:
- Start this server, then register client apps with admin client starter

Learning goals:
- Observability with minimal setup
- Operational visibility for teams

== spring-boot-config-server

Centralized configuration with Spring Cloud Config:
- Git-backed properties
- Environment-specific files
- Encryption/decryption support

How to run:
- Point spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri to a repo
- Clients fetch configuration at bootstrap

Learning goals:
- Central config management
- Safe secret handling and refresh

== spring-boot-data-jpa-flyway

Persistence + migrations:
- Spring Data JPA repositories
- Transactions and entity mapping
- Flyway versioned migrations

How to run:
- mvn spring-boot:run (Flyway runs at startup)

Learning goals:
- Reliable schema evolution
- Clean repository design
- Testing data layers

== spring-boot-openapi-root

Parent for OpenAPI samples providing:
- Dependency and plugin alignment
- Shared conventions for documentation

Learning goals:
- Organizing API documentation across modules

=== openapi-sample

Concrete OpenAPI demo:
- springdoc-openapi integration
- Swagger UI
- Schemas and validation annotations

How to run:
- mvn spring-boot:run
- Visit /swagger-ui.html

Learning goals:
- API-first documentation
- Accurate schemas and examples

== spring-boot-thymeleaf

Server-side MVC with Thymeleaf:
- Templates, fragments, and layouts
- Form binding and validation
- I18n support

How to run:
- mvn spring-boot:run
- Visit web UI routes

Learning goals:
- Productive SSR development
- Clean template composition

== spring-boot-security-root

Parent for security samples:
- Baseline dependencies
- Shared configuration practices

Learning goals:
- Consistent security setup across modules

=== spring-boot-security-basic

Basic authentication:
- In-memory users/roles
- Form login and protected routes

How to run:
- mvn spring-boot:run
- Access a protected endpoint to see login flow

Learning goals:
- Security filter chain basics
- Method and URL-based authorization

=== spring-boot-security-jwt

JWT-based security:
- Token issuance/validation
- Stateless sessions
- Role-based access

How to run:
- Obtain token via auth endpoint
- Call protected APIs with Authorization: Bearer <token>

Learning goals:
- API security at scale
- Token lifecycle and best practices

== spring-boot-ai-samples

AI integrations with Spring AI:
- Chat/completions flows
- Prompt engineering patterns
- Retry and observability

How to run:
- Configure AI provider credentials via env/properties
- mvn spring-boot:run

Learning goals:
- Safely integrate AI services
- Reusable abstractions for AI features
